# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Why would you use the method `super()`?

  Your answer: he super() method is used in a child class to access the methods that are stored in the parent class.

  Researched answer: super() is a method thats used in other programming languages, not just javascript.



2. What is the DOM? What is the virtual DOM?

  Your answer: A DOM is where a coder can manipulate and change what's being displayed on an HTML server.  The virtual DOM does not display it, rather you can use it to test any changes you would make to the DOM before running it.

  Researched answer: Virtual DOMs change a lot quicker.



3. What is a higher-order function?

  Your answer: A higher-order function has functions within it to callback on within its own box of codes.  It carries a variety of methods and arguments that the coder writes out, but it also has its own built in functions such as .map, .filter, and .forEach()

  Researched answer: .map, .filter, and .forEach() are built in functions that loop through an argument to save time on creating a for loop.



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a mix of code between HTML and JavaScript.

  Your answer: Yarn was also created by Facebook.  Yarn takes a compilation of files and puts them together to allow the programmer to implement new technologies and commands in their computer.  Running '$ yarn' allows you to do this action.

  Researched answer: Yarn manages and compiles files (like how yarn would stitch things together) together in your compiler.



7. What is localhost:3000? How do we use localhost:3000 in the development process?

  Your answer: localhost: 3000 is a local server you can run your lines of js code and see how it displays on your page.  It's perfect for fixing broken code and experimenting.

  Researched answer:  localhost:3000 is a loopack, meaning it refreshes itself in real time as you change and save your code.



8. What is an iterable in JavaScript? What data types are iterables? How can this information useful to you as a developer?

  Your answer:  Iterables are loop iterations that run through your data until the job is complete.  Different types of iterations are .map, .filter and for loops.  This helps me as a developer to space time reiterating and creating too many lines of code that take up space.

  Researched answer:  Iterables are loop iterations that run through your data until the job is complete.  Different types of iterations are .map, .filter and for loops.  This helps me as a developer to space time reiterating and creating too many lines of code that take up space.
